Spatial Graph Convolution Network for Accurate fMRI Data Classification
======
* Spatial graph convolution on ROI-based fMRI data for mental disorder classification
* K-nearest neighbors graph for convolutions based on group functional connectivity (FC)
* Asymmetric edge function for co-activation pattern modeling of fMRI data
* Topological property comparison between k-NN graph and the threshold FC
