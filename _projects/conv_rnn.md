Convolution Neural Network for interpretable fMRI Data Analysis
======
* CNN on ROI-based fMRI data for co-activation pattern extraction with good generalization
* Recurrent neural networks for the temporal dynamics modeling of fMRI data
* Salient region visualization based on soft-attention, occlusion and gradient method
* Different data preprocessing methods and dynamic data augmentation for training
